# My Solutions to Tour of Go

[Link to the Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)

**IMPORTANT**: The main point of the Go tour is to challenge you, so please try to
solve all problems by yourself before reading these solutions!!!

In any case, these are not the only valid solutions. These are just what I came up with
when learning go myself :)
